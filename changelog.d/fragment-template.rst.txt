Changelog Writing Instructions:

1.  Select the category that best fits your change.

2.  Delete all text from your file outside your category's section (including this
    instruction block).

3.  Edit the remaining bullet point to describe your change.

    *   For changelog consistency, use present-tense, active verbs:
        ✅ "Add support for a new feature."
        ❌ "Added support for a new feature."
        ❌ "A new feature is supported."

{% for category in config.categories %}
{{ category }}
{{ config.rst_header_chars[1] * (category|length) }}

*   Describe your "{{ category }}" change here. EDIT ME!
{% endfor -%}
