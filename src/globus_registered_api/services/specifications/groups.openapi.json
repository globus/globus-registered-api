Only `invited` memberships can `accept`.\n- **add**: Identities in the `add` list will be added to the group as long\n  as the identity exists and they have not previously left the group, or indicated\n  via settings that they can not be added to any group. Adding an identity which\n  already have an active membership in the group will not modify the membership,\n  and is an error for informational purposes. All active admins and managers are\n  permitted to add members to a group. Active admins are also permitted to add\n  admins and managers to a group.  Role is an optional parameter to set the\n  membership role on addition.\n- **approve**: Identities in the `approve` list will be\n  accepted into the group. Only `pending` memberships can be included in\n  the `approve` list. All active admins and managers are permitted to approve\n  pending members to a group.\n- **change_role**: Identities in the `change_role` list whose roles in the group are\n  to be updated.  Only admins can change member roles.  Only `active` memberships\n  are eligible for role changes.\n- **decline**: Identities in the `decline` list which are in the users identity set\n  will be rejected from the group. Only `invited` memberships can `decline`.\n- **invite**:  Identities in the `invite` list will be invited to join the group.\n  All active admins and managers are permitted to invite members to a group. Members\n  may also invite other members if the policy allows it. Role is an optional\n  parameter to set the membership role on invitation.\n- **join**: Identities in the `join` list which are in the users identity set\n  will join the group, if the group policy is to allow users to join. High Assurance\n  groups cannot use this action.\n- **leave**: Identities in the `leave` list which are in the users identity set\n  will be removed from the group. Only `active` memberships can `leave`. If the\n  identity is the last remaining `admin` of the group leaving is not allowed,\n  since this would leave the group in an orphaned state.\n- **reject**: Identities in the `reject` list will be\n  rejected from the group. Only `pending` memberships can be included in\n  the `reject` list. All active admins and managers are permitted to reject pending\n  members from a group.\n- **remove**: Identities in the `remove` list will be removed from the group.\n  Admins can remove admins, managers, and members. Managers can remove managers and\n  members. Regular members cannot remove any members. Only `active` and `invited`\n  memberships can be removed, and users cannot remove their own memberships.\n- **request_join**: Identities in the `request_join` list which are in the users\n  identity set will be set as pending memberships for the group if the group policy\n  requires membership approval. Pending memberships must be approved or rejected by\n  administrators or managers.\n\nThe response will include the current state of any membership that was\nsuccessfully processed. The response will also include a list of errors\nindicating the identity of any requested membership action that failed to\nbe processed.\n\nIdentity IDs must be unique across all actions in the same call. For example,\ntrying to add and remove the same identity in the same request will cause the\nentire request to fail.",
